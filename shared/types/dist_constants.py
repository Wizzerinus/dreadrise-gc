            GetRotationAngle: Function which returns the angle the card should be rotated by.
            GetSideboardImportance: Function which takes a sideboard card, and the count of it in the sideboard,
            and returns how important is that card, at the scale 1 = 1 mainboard copy, 4 = mainboard playset
            (e.g. companions, first mates, etc)

            Update: is called when the server is initialized
            ParseGateway: Parses a gateway query. The query will include the "gateway_key" field (checked at top level)
            and the "action" field (must be checked by the distribution). The output must include "success" (bool)
